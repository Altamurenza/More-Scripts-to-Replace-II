# More-Scripts-to-Replace-II
More Scripts to Replace (MSR) is just a small mod to utilize the game empty space in order to run multiple free roam mods at once. This mod does not use STimeCycle to give more space by letting one environment run independently. 

Features:
- Up to 5 STimeCycle scripts can be loaded in "../Scripts/MSR_II/GROUP_01_STC/" folder.
- Up to 5 STimeCycle scripts can be loaded in "../Scripts/MSR_II/GROUP_02_STC/" folder.
- Up to 10 Non-STimeCycle scripts can be loaded in "../Scripts/MSR_II/GROUP_03_NonSTC/" folder.
- Does not require IMG Console or IMG Tools 2.0 to install scripts.

Although this mod is not perfect, it is safe to say this can run 20 scripts in pretty much stable condition as long as the installed mods are not conflicting each other. Do not install another game trainer mod if you already have one, they will likely cause a conflict.
